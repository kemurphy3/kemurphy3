## Hi there, I'm Murph!

I'm a data scientist with 13 years experience working with environmental and geospatial data. My current focus is on building ML models, RAG systems, and evaluation frameworks through Murphy Analytics LLC. I am also pursuing NASM certification while I build out Cleared Fitness, a coaching platform for post-rehab clients.
